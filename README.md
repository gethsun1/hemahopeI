## Introduction
HemaHope is a React application integrated with Ethereum smart contracts to provide a decentralized platform for managing charity campaigns. The platform allows users to create campaigns, receive physical item donations, and track the progress of each campaign in real-time. 

HemaHope smart contracts are deployed on Dymesion's RollApp X Testnet, leveraging Dymesion's Efficient RDK (RollApp Development Kit) for enhanced security and access to liquidity.

## Features
- **Create Campaigns:** Easily create new charity campaigns with detailed descriptions, target items, and duration settings.
- **Receive Donations:** Donors can contribute physical items to campaigns, with every donation securely recorded on the blockchain.
- **Track Campaigns:** Real-time tracking of all active campaigns and their progress.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Secure and transparent automation of the donation process.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and responsive design for accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - CSS

- **Blockchain:**
  - Solidity
  - Ethers.js
  - Web3.js

- **Deployment:**
  - Dymesion's RollApp X Testnet

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gethsun1/hemahope.git
   cd hemahope
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<Your Infura Project ID>
   REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Your Deployed Contract Address>
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Smart Contracts Deployment
HemaHope's smart contracts are deployed on Dymesion's RollApp X Testnet. Dymesion's Efficient RDK facilitates the development and deployment process by providing pre-defined modules for minting native tokens, onchain governance, and bridging.

### Deployment Steps
1. Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler.
2. Deploy the compiled contracts to Dymesion's RollApp X Testnet.
3. Update the contract addresses in the frontend application.

### RollApps Overview
- **Tokens:** Mint, charge gas for transactions, and distribute tokens with custom configurations.
- **Governance:** Decentralized onchain governance mechanism for distributing control over onchain parameters and funds.
- **Bridging:** IBC bridging for access to the extensive IBC ecosystem, including currencies like USDC and USDT.

### Deploying EVM Compatible Smart Contracts
Dymesionâ€™s RollApp X Testnet supports deploying Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contracts. This compatibility ensures that developers can use familiar tools and languages like Solidity to create and deploy smart contracts.

1. **Compile Your Contracts:** Use tools like Truffle or Hardhat to compile your Solidity contracts.
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   # or using Hardhat
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy to RollApp X Testnet:** Configure your deployment scripts to target Dymesion's RollApp X Testnet. Ensure you have the network configuration set up properly.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     networks: {
       rollappX: {
         provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://rollappX.infura.io/v3/${infuraProjectId}`),
         network_id: 1234, // RollApp X Testnet ID
         gas: 5500000,
         confirmations: 2,
         timeoutBlocks: 200,
         skipDryRun: true
       }
     },
     // Other configurations...
   };
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Configurations:** Once deployed, update the frontend application with the new contract addresses and ABI.

## Usage
1. **Connect Wallet:** Use the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. **Create Campaign:** Fill out the form with campaign details and submit to create a new campaign.
3. **Donate:** Choose an active campaign and donate physical items.
4. **Track Progress:** Monitor the progress of each campaign in real-time.
